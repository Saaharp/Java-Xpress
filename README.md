## Optimizations:

Quick Order Templates: Create pre-defined order templates for popular or frequently ordered items, enabling cashiers to quickly select and modify orders with a few clicks.

Order Notes or Special Instructions: Provide an option for cashiers to include specific notes or special instructions from customers, such as dietary preferences or allergies.

Customer Profiles: Implement a customer profile feature that stores customer preferences, order history, and loyalty program details.
